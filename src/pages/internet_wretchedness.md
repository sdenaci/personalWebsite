Is too much of this meager blog taken up by Mario Levrero? Arguably, but who cares? Certainly not me. For one, the act of translating him, the intense focus (on him and and on the notion of clarity and concisity (?) itself ) makes me a better programmer. (Also programming makes me a better translator of him). Also, he has some amazingly insightful, comments about the nature of the internet and programming itself. See this great passage (translated by me, this morning) from <i>La novela luminosa</i> (a diary-novel in which coding plays a shockingly large roll), written at 6:58 a.m. on Christmas Eve of the year 2000:

Certainly, the world of computing has already been invaded by the wretched, and as all of it becomes even cheaper, so will the wretchedness increase. Not because the poor are necessarily wretched (although they often are, sometimes as much so as the rich), but because the canny individuals among us will use these technological marvels to benumb the poor, that is, the poor who live tin ranches with a TV antena, even more profoundly than they already do. And in passing those same people, by which I mean “the powerful,” will benumb themselves too. They were always brutes in a certain sense, and now they’ll be even bigger ones, thanks to technology. The internet will definitively leave the cultural sphere where it was born, and will be manged by salespeople and statisticians. However, the fundamental structure of the computer, the human intelligence that made it work in the first place, this will continue to function. There will always be a world to puzzle out, with which to converse, becuase it’s one that’s necessarily goverened by logic. The machine won’t work without logic. Even though the person handles it may not be so logical. An dribbling soccer fan can already operate certain buttons and obtain a few results. Soon he will be able to obtain many more, with less intellectual exhaustion. Nonetheless, perhaps there will continue to be solitary individuals who still prefer to converse with the bowels of an operating system on Chirstmas Eve, indifferent to the fireworks* and the drunkenness.

*translator’s note: a Gentle Reminder, dear Reader, that in Uruguay, Christmas falls during their summer, so there are fireworks and pools and swimming and sexier parties.
