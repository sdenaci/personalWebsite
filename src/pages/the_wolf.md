Mario Levero is an author who  lived from 1940-2004, mostly in Uruguay, sometimes in Argentina. He is one of my favorite chroniclers of inward experience, and the messyness of things like that. He also loved to program (mostly, it seems, in Visual Basic). The clarity, the exactitude of his prose, his comitment to readability, make me believe he was probably an excellent programmer. I’ve attempted to translate his masterwork, La novela luminosa, many times, but he writes with with such a profound clarity, with such exactitude in his word choice, that I always give up, frusturated. The other night, I was rereading Irrupciones, a colection of his newspaper columns, and was so struck by this passage, that I decided to try translating him again. Here it is!:


<h3 style="font-family: 'courier'">THE WOLF</h3>

<p style="font-family: 'courier'">
“Is The Wolf coming?”
</p>

<p style="font-family: 'courier'">
It was with this question that the little girl barged into my night and my life. I wanted to be worthy of the circumstances, and so I responded calmly and authoritatively:
</p>

<p style="font-family: 'courier'">
“No, he’s not coming.”
</p>

<p style="font-family: 'courier'">
And then I immediately went further than expected:
</p>

<p style="font-family: 'courier'">
“Wolves don’t exist,” I added. This made her distrust me because she hadn’t been talking about wolves in general, but rather one specific, concrete wolf: The Wolf. My response collided with her expectations, with what she had been taught, and almost, I’d say, with her life experience. I immediately realized my error, but I didn’t have any time to correct it.
</p>

<p style="font-family: 'courier'">
“The Wolf doesn’t exist?” she asked.
</p>

<p style="font-family: 'courier'">
I couldn’t allow myself to shake her world like this. Someone she trusted, perhaps even her grandmother, had incorporated this necessary figure of The Wolf into her life, and now because of me the girl was probably already calling into question the existence of The Epiphany, and now was maybe transfering this doubt to The Wolf, and to who knows what else. I tried to repair, to reconcile, to curb the chaos that I had begun to unleash.
</p>

<p style="font-family: 'courier'">
“In the past,” I said, with emphasis, “in the past he used to exist. Not anymore. He died.”
</p>

<p style="font-family: 'courier'">
My joy at having found this elegant solution was brief. The girl opened her eyes very wide, yelled out something I couldn’t make out, covered her ears with her hands, began to let out shrieks, and ran away.
</p>

<p style="font-family: 'courier'">
My wife had watched the scene. She explained:
</p>

<p style="font-family: 'courier'">
“Before she started shrieking, what she yelled was: ‘He’s coming anyway!’”
</p>

<p style="font-family: 'courier'">
The little girl was right. The Wolf, obviously, is an archetype, and, as such, he can’t die. If he’s killed, he’s coming anyway, like in all those horror films. A Wolf still comes, only he is a much more horrible, a much more awful Wof, a dead Wolf. A Wolf who can’t be stopped, because he can’t be killed, because he’s dead. And he’s coming anyway.
